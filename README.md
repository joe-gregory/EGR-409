# Machine Design II - Shaft Solver

This is a Python-based project developed as a part of the Machine Design II course in Mechanical Engineering.

## Project Description

The Shaft Solver is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that facilitates the analysis of shafts under various load conditions. It takes various parameters as input, such as the shaft diameter, elasticity modulus, shaft length, load conditions, etc., and calculates deflections, moments of inertia, and torsion moments.

## Technologies

The application was developed using Python 3.4 and PySide 1.2.2 for the GUI.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.4: Download and install Python 3.4 from the [Python official downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3410/).
   
2. Install the required packages: PySide and Pint. Run the following commands to install them:
   ```bash
   py -3.4 -m pip install PySide==1.2.2
   py -3.4 -m pip install pint==0.9
